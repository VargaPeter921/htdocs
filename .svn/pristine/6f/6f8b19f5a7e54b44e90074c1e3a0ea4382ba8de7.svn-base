### Version Notes

The 1.x.x versions are for Laravel 4.2, 2.x.x versions are for Laravel 5.1+ 

#### 2.1.4

- Fix: #22, find function isn't supported in laravel 5
- Add: show references for keys that have source reference information. Need to run `Add
  References` to update source references and add new groups/keys from source files and views.
  Currently app/ and all view paths are checked. Command line can give specific path to search.
  need to run migrations for this update: [Installation: Publishing And Running Migrations]

#### 2.1.3

- Fix: #31, translations:import is not working for windows based paths

#### 2.1.2

- Fix: #32, `user_list_connection` in `db_connections` configuration was ignored instead of being
  used to retrieve the user list for the given connection.
- Fix: change default config sample from `caouecs/laravel4-lang` to `caouecs/laravel-lang` as
  needed by this package for Laravel 5.
- Fix: #33, Laravel 5.2 - "symfony/finder": "2.8.*|3.0.*" dependency mismatch

#### 2.1.1

- Fix: #30, mismatch in class names
- Add: config option `markdown_key_suffix` and code to handle markdown to html conversion of
  translations for keys ending in this suffix. Converted HTML is stored in a key with the suffix
  removed. For now this is an experimental feature. 

#### 2.1.0

- Change: upgrade to Laravel 5.2 (.31 to be exact) 

- Change: using abilities to handle all LTM related authorization and providing a list of
  translation editors. Abilities:
    - `ltm-admin-translations` true/false for users that can administer LTM through web UI
    
    - `ltm-bypass-lottery` true/false for users that bypass the missing key lottery. For these
      users all sessions track missing keys.
    
    - `ltm-list-editors` true/false
    
    Takes a reference argument in which to return an array of objects with `id`, `email` and
    optional `name` fields used for managing per locale access. `connection` parameter is the
    current connection name that can used to modify how the list is generated.
    
    See
    [Enabling per locale user access control](../../wiki/Configuration#enabling-per-locale-user-access-control)
    
- Change: remove dependency on UserPrivilegeManager package. It was only needed for
  Laravel 4.

- Add: Middleware to handle equivalent of `listen('route.after'...)` event so that translation
  manager's cached translations can be persisted to a cache.

- Fix: #29, Closure in config file breaks config:cache, removed the config closure. Per locale
  access control implemented using LtmPolicy with all abilities in version 2.1.0. LTM provides 
  an empty user list for locale management by default. 

- Add: color highlight for key regex text box and radio button translation filters to visually
  signal when key list is incomplete and which filter is responsible:
    - no filter: normal
    - filter with matched keys: blue
    - filter with no matched keys: red

#### 2.0.41

- Fix: #24, Translation Work Orders: Allow users to access only some languages. Basic user per
  locale access management available to users for whom `UserCan::admin_translations()` return
  true. See
  [Enabling per locale user access control](../../wiki/Configuration#enabling-per-locale-user-access-control) 
- Fix: access control for non-admin users so that they cannot inadvertently delete keys or
  modify locales to which they have no access.

#### 2.0.40

- Fix: #28, name of DB connection should be definable in config file - feature request. Now can
  add `database_name` to package config which will override the database name defined for the
  connection. Similarly, alternate connections can have their own database name settings, use
  the globally defined one in package config file or use the connection's database name.

#### 2.0.39
#### 2.0.38

- merge #26, handling of numeric translation keys

#### 2.0.37

- fix#25, Delete button not working for some keys, solved by double url encoding translation key 
  to get around Laravel url decoding before applying the routing logic to the URL. 

#### 2.0.36

- fix workbench language files were not saved and caused a server exception, suspect this was 
  introduced with upgrade to PHP 7.0 which handles array_replace_recursive differently than PHP 
  5.6. It appears that 7.0 does a copy by reference not by value if there is only one reference 
  to an item in an array. 
- fix improper test for existence of language file was not testing if the path was a directory. 
- change laravelcollective/html dependency to 5.2 to make it Laravel 5.2 compatible 
- change all Input:: to Request:: for Laravel 5.2 compatibility 
- add 'web' to middleware in config otherwise Laravel 5.2 does not initialize session object 

#### x.0.35

- add database table prefix handling in hand rolled queries

#### x.0.34

- fix cached entries were filtered out by query so they never showed in web UI 
- add merge PR from @killtw for Laravel 5.2 support in composer.json

#### x.0.33

- add cached column to dashboard to show translations that were published to the cache, but have 
  not been saved to server files 
- fix a bunch of typos in translation.css attributes
- change translations that have changes published to the cached have table cell background hue 
  matching cached stats colors in dashboard 
- change deleted column in dashboard to hot-pink-purple and show stats in bold and color so they 
  stand out 
- change deleted unpublished translation rows in table to match hue of the dashboard color 

#### x.0.32

- fix translations were not using selected remote connection for edit and default connection 
  values were being displayed in the translation table for empty remote translations 
- add cache translations for the group being edited for the session so that all translations for 
  the page are loaded in one db query 
- fix empty translations would show in the dashboard as unpublished when in-database-publish 
  mode is used 
- add table cell highlight of unpublished changed translations so that they are easier to locate 
- add table cell highlight of cached published translations so that they stand out from actual 
  unpublished changes 
- fix dashboard no longer shows cached published translations as changed 
- fix move keys would fail if destination had existing key. Now conflicting destination keys are 
  deleted and replaced by the moved keys. 
- fix translation edit pop-up to caps now lower cases the affected text then proper caps it. 
- add translation edit pop-up button to cap just the first character of the translation and the 
  rest lowercase. 
- add auto lower case all except the first character of translations only if translation text 
  contains only letters, digits or white space, optionally terminated by a period. 
- add mark visible translations as deleted, and un-mark visible translations as deleted. 
- add persistence of translation filter selection between page refreshes. 
- change 'Show Unpublished' to only show changed or deleted translations. Used to also show 
  missing translations. 
- add 'Need Attention' filter option to show missing, changed or deleted translations. This used 
  to be what 'Show Unpublished' displayed. 
- add 'New' filter option to show only rows that have no translations. 
- Change remove 'Show' prefix from all filter radio buttons to save real-estate. 
- fix importing with 'delete all then import' was not preserving usage information. 
- fix Auto Translate and Auto Fill to only affect rows that are visible, ie. not filtered out. 

#### x.0.31

- fix error reporting for wild card key operations would show empty alert. 
- fix discrepancy between changed status in dashboard view and show changed radio button 
  translation results. 
- add unpublished radio button to show translations that need attention or will be modified on 
  next publish. These are: deleted, changed or missing. 
- add text box for regex to show translations whose keys match regex in the text box. Applied on 
  top of other radio button filtering. 
- add filtered key stats display in the translations table key column. Shows total displayed 
  after regex filtering vs total from radio buttons vs total keys. 
- add `show_locales` config option to limit the locales to ones contained in the option. If 
  empty or not provided then all locales from the database will be shown. Only affects locales 
  shown. All locales are imported and exported regardless of this setting. 

#### 1.0.30 - 2.0.30

- fix import of locale sub-directories. Note that in L4 you access translations in 
  sub-directories by using the `.` as separator in L5 this is `/`. In translation manager the 
  group will have a period in all Laravel Versions. For example for directory structure like the 
  following: 

    ```text
    lang
    └── en
        └── test
            ├── sub-dir
            │ └── sub-sub-test.php
            └── subtest.php
    ```

    You would access translations:

    - in L5 as `@lang('test/subtest.translation-key')` for `subtest.php` and as 
      `@lang('test/sub-dir/sub-sub-test.translation-key')` for `sub-sub-test.php`. 

    - in L4 as `@lang('test.subtest.translation-key')` for `subtest.php` and as 
      `@lang('test.sub-dir.sub-sub-test.translation-key')` for `sub-sub-test.php`. 

    In both cases the group in translation manager will show as `test.subtest` and 
    `test.sub-dir.sub-sub-test`. It was too big a pain to support `/` in group names because 
    these are passed in the URL as parameters and having slashes messes things up. URL encoding 
    is no help because Laravel cannot resolve the path. 

#### x.0.29

- fix formSubmit() was not properly processing translation result for inPlaceEdit() mode 
- fix moved csrf meta from index.blade.php to layouts.master.blade.php so that all pages that 
  extend layouts.master can use in-place-edit mode. 
- move most of the details from the readme to the wiki. 
- fix runtime exception if workbench projects are present but the config has an empty include 
  for workbench config. 
- fix replace deprecated \Route::after()
- add key usage logging. Similar to missing keys except it logs keys that were accessed. 
- add alternate database connection to config and to web interface. Can manage production 
  translations from local dev environment. 
- fix keyOps to handle group names for wbn: and vnd: prefixed names. Now can move/copy keys from 
  normal groups to these ones. 
- fix translations page now redirects to 'no group selected' url if the requested group no 
  longer exists. 
- change locales that are part of the working set are moved to the front of the lists to ease 
  their selection. 
- add batch insert mode for new translations. Uses insert into with a list of values instead of 
  invoking db connection for each one. Speeds up imports of new translations and initial import 
  significantly, especially for remote database connections. 
- add now missing translation keys for packages from vendor and workbench directories will have 
  these keys added to the appropriate vendor/workbench group if there are no translations for 
  the package in the project. Makes working on code in workbench and vendor directories that 
  references a new translation easier. Previously the new key would be created under the package 
  name but in the project space instead of the vendor/workbench (ie. vnd: or wbn: prefixed 
  group) name space. 
- add buttons to filter translation rows: show all, show non-empty, show empty, show changed, 
  show deleted 
- fix indatabase_publish was not working since usage tracking was added. 
- add auto translate buttons to all locale column headers not just the translating locale. 
- fix exception when 'log_missing_keys' is disabled in configuration and translation manager 
  in-place-edit mode is used. Issue: #10 
- add `locales` config entry for additional locales that are to be included in the locales list 
  even if these don't have translation files or translations in the database. That way you can 
  add locales by adding translations for them in translation manager without having to create 
  the directories with a single group file and a single translation key to get locales added to 
  your translations.
